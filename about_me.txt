This is the start of a paragraph about me (sorry if i dont know how to start this)
To start this simple I am 20 years old (nearly 21) I live in the town houses in collage currently but i normaly live in simcoe with my brother who is 2 years older than me.
My normal hobbies include Video games, Drawing, Table top games and just watching Youtube.
I currently have one brother (22) and a mother and father (divorced).
My other relatives include 4 cousins 3 grandparents 3 uncles and 2 aunts, these are all the ones i know of/ can remember.
I am hopeing to go into a much more design focused job after finishing this program.
and that is pretty much what i can think to write for a basic summery of myself.
